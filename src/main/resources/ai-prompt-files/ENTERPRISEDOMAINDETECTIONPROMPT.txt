You are a database architect.

I will give you a JSON file containing database schema metadata.

Your task:
1. Group tables into logical business domains.
2. Use business meaning, naming similarity, shared column names, and foreign key relationships.
3. Keep each domain under 30 tables if possible.
4. Every table must belong to exactly one domain.
5. Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:
6. Prefer grouping by connected foreign key graph components first.
7. Then refine by business naming.
8. If a domain exceeds 30 tables, split it into logical subdomains.

{
  "Domain Name 1": ["table1", "table2"],
  "Domain Name 2": ["table3"]
}

Do not return explanations.
Do not return markdown.
Only return valid JSON.

Here is the schema:
